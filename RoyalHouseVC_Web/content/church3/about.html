								<p> In October 1998, the Apostle-General first visited Connecticut at the invitation of some friends as the
									main speaker at a revival in East Hartford.
									In July 1999, some early interest was established in terms of wanting to plant a church in Connecticut,
									and so, after much prayer, Royalhouse Chapel was started in the basement of the Church of the Nazarene,
									218 Main Street, Manchester, CT. The church met and fellowshipped at this location until May 2000,
									when some of the members decided to break off and start their own ministry. The remaining members of
									Royalhouse Chapel, 7 people in total, led by the then resident Pastor, Rev. Charles Benneh, began to meet
									at 65 Enfield Avenue, Hartford, CT, the home of one of the church leaders.

									<h2>May 2000 - Fall 2004 (Manchester, CT)</h2>
									<hr class="no_line" style="margin: 0 auto 20px auto">
									<p> From about May 2000 to late 2004, the church met at 856 Main Street, Manchester, CT. Those early years
										were very challenging, as we attempted to establish the vision of Royalhouse Chapel in an area that had
										not previously heard of us. 
									 </p>
									<hr class="no_line" style="margin: 0 auto 20px auto">
									<p> During these years, the church was pastored by Rev. Charles Benneh, and
										subsequently by Rev. Joseph Essilfie, who transitioned to New York in 2004 to start the church plant
										there. This transition to New York essentially left the church without a pastor, which resulted in Rev.
										Thomas stepping up to steer the ministry and keep it afloat, aided by a few committed members.

									<p> In late 2004, the church was forced to relocate to a temporary meeting location at the Super 8 Motel, also
										in Manchester, CT 06040. This move was necessitated due to leasing terms dictated by our previous

										November 2009, he was formally inducted as the pastor of the church. This ended the era of many

										ushered the church into a season of relative calm and stability.

									<h2>July 2010- May 2023 (South Windsor, CT)</h2>
									<hr class="no_line" style="margin: 0 auto 20px auto">
									<p> Although the East Windsor location served us well, it was geographically too far for most of our members
										to drive to. In addition to that, the layout of the building was not suitable in terms of attracting a wide
										demographic of people. Consequently, a decision was made by leadership to look for a location that was
										more central to where most of our congregation was coming from, and which was also bigger, in order to
										accommodate where we believed God was taking us.
									 </p>
									<hr class="no_line" style="margin: 0 auto 20px auto">
									<p> We experienced God's faithfulness in a unique way at this time. Led again by Rev. Thomas, the church
										members congregated at the new site one Sunday in May 2010 to anoint and to pray over the grounds. It
										was at this meeting that Rev. Thomas laid out the vision to the congregation for what he wanted to
										accomplish. Although there were some naysayers, a vast majority of our members bought into this vision,
										contributing generously and raising the money needed to renovate the space at 52A Connecticut Avenue
										and make it our new home.
									</p>
									<hr class="no_line" style="margin: 0 auto 20px auto">
									<p>
										Our first church service at this location was held in July 2010, with about 35 people in attendance, and
										Rev. Dalkeith Amanor as the Guest Speaker for that opening weekend. In November 2009, the church
										space was dedicated to the Lord by the Apostle-General, and the name 'Victory Center' bestowed on the
										church by the leading of the Holy Spirit. We also inducted church officers in November 2012 to help
										stabilize and bring structure to the ministry.
									</p>
									<hr class="no_line" style="margin: 0 auto 20px auto">
									<p>
										Under Rev. Thomas' leadership, and ably supported by First Lady Ps. Mama Ama Brew, the church
										stabilized and grew during this time, becoming a thriving multi-cultural congregation, touching and
										transforming lives, and empowering people from all walks of life to live victoriously for Jesus Christ. It
										was at this place that God showed His power mightily, and many lives were saved and transformed to the
										glory of God. Although the church went through many diverse challenges and storms, His faithfulness
										remained steadfast and unchangeable. We purchased two 15 passenger vans to be used for campus
										ministry initiatives, and expanded our reach and influence in the community.

								<h2>May 2023 to Present (East Hartford, CT)</h2>
								<hr class="no_line" style="margin: 0 auto 30px auto">
								<p> It had always been Rev. Thomas dream and desire for the church in Connecticut to have a place to call
									home. Having lived through the many changing scenes of tumult and chaos the church had suffered, he
									firmly believed that God would use him to lead the church to its 'promised land'. After searching for many
									years, the church finally located a property at 1120 Silver Lane, East Hartford, CT 06118 that would be
									suitable for its need. Rev. Thomas led the church in prayer concerning the property and aggressively
									
									mobilized resources to position us to make the purchase. Through a massive fundraising effort, and
									through God's providence, the sellers accepted our offer out of twelve others, and we were able to close
									on the property on February 3, 2023. Valued at $1.5 million, and with over $600, 000 worth of
									renovations poured into it, this edifice now stands as the new home of Royalhouse Chapel, Victory Center,
									and will now serve as a place of transformation, community impact, a home for all, and the dwelling place
									of the most high God.
								 </p>
								<hr class="no_line" style="margin: 0 auto 20px auto">
								<p> We continue to trust God in our relentless pursuit of souls for Christ in the community and surrounding
									areas, bringing them into the sheepfold, with the sole purpose of restoring them, transforming them,
									unearthing their God-give potential, enabling them to discover their God-given purpose, and equipping
									them to live victoriously for Christ. This is the essence of our church's mission, which is to touch our
									generation with the power of God. </p>
